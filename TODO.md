# Todo

Long-time features under consideration / development:

- library to exchange PASS Process Models
- validation and verification unit

## Backlog:


### Performance

The available actions are not refreshed automatically. To refresh them you have to hit the enter key regularly.

I will try to use the CoreASM Compiler instead of the Interpreter to gain more performance.

I am also planning to add a feedback channel from the process interpretation to the console application to automatically reload the available actions.
