# Autodetect text files and ensure that we normalise their
# line endings to lf internally. When checked out they may
# use different line endings.
* text=auto

# Check out with crlf (Windows) line endings
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf

# Check out with lf (UNIX) line endings
*.sh text eol=lf

# For the remaining files the line endings of checked out
# files is defined by the ``core.eol`` git config variable.
# By default this is the native line ending for the platform.
